A Powerful Radio Streaming SDK for iOS App Developers!
===

RadioTunes SDK is written for iOS developers who want to add radio streaming functionality to their app using a couple lines of code. Behind the scenes RadioTunes relies on the iOS AudioQueue framework and the open source LGPL licensed FFmpeg library.

If your app does not require mms/wma codec functionality you can also use RadioTunes SDK without including the FFmpeg library. The code for mms streaming is completely separated from the code for http streaming so that you can choose which portions of code you want to include in your project.

Note: The demo project will only play radio streams for a limited time only.
